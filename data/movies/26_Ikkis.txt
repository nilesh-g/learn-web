Brief Idea / Storyline:
Ikkis (meaning "Twenty-one") is a war drama that tells the true, untold story of Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, India's youngest recipient of the Param Vir Chakra - the nation's highest military decoration for valor. The film follows Arun's extraordinary courage and sacrifice during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, specifically the Battle of Basantar. Despite sustaining injuries when his tank is hit, Arun continues fighting with fierce determination and bravery, ultimately sacrificing his life for his country at the age of 21. The narrative chronicles his heroic actions and the circumstances that led to his becoming a national symbol of patriotic valor. Through his story, the film explores themes of duty, sacrifice, courage, and the unwavering commitment of a soldier to his nation. The film serves as both a tribute to a young war hero and, emotionally, a farewell to the legendary actor Dharmendra.

Audience Review:
Ikkis has generated significant anticipation and emotional response from audiences. The film marks the theatrical debut of Agastya Nanda, grandson of Amitabh Bachchan, in a pivotal leading role. The casting has been well-received with audiences appreciating the choice of a young actor to portray the young soldier. The film's promise of delivering a gripping war drama filled with patriotism and emotional depth has resonated strongly. Notably, this is Dharmendra's last film before his passing in November 2025, adding an emotional layer to the release. The trailer has been well-received, conveying both the action elements and the emotional core of the story. Audiences have shown reverence for the film as a tribute to both the war hero and the legendary actor.

Relevant Information:
Ikkis is directed by Sriram Raghavan, marking his first war film. The film is presented by Maddock Films (Dinesh Vijan) and produced by various stakeholders. The cast includes Agastya Nanda in his theatrical debut as Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, Simar Bhatia (niece of Akshay Kumar) in her acting debut, Jaideep Ahlawat in a supporting role, and Dharmendra as Brigadier M. L. Khetarpal, Arun's father. This marks Dharmendra's posthumous release and his final film appearance. The original release date of December 25, 2025, was postponed to January 1, 2026, to avoid clashing with other films and to provide the film with a solo release opportunity. The postponement decision was made by producer Dinesh Vijan, who had successfully employed similar strategies with previous films like "Hindi Medium" and "Chhaava." The film represents a significant war drama in contemporary Indian cinema with strong emotional and patriotic resonance.
