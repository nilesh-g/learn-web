Brief Idea / Storyline:
Vrusshabha is a bilingual epic fantasy action drama shot simultaneously in Malayalam and Telugu, with dubbed versions in Hindi and Kannada. The film explores the deep and unbreakable bond between a father and son through a narrative that spans two timelines and two worlds. The story moves from the grandeur of an ancient monarchy to the intensity of the present era. In the present timeline, Aadi Deva Varma, a powerful businessman, begins experiencing visions suggesting a connection to a former life. Gradually, the narrative reveals his past incarnation as Vijayendra Vrusshabha, a mighty king and warrior whose actions left unresolved consequences. The film's narrative tests the father-son bond in unexpected ways, taking audiences on a stirring journey of love, sacrifice, and destiny.

Audience Review:
Vrusshabha has been positioned as a grand pan-Indian film with massive production values and high expectations. While the film features Mohanlal in his first portrayal of a king, which has been a point of interest for audiences, it has been characterized as a box office disaster despite the star power and ambitions of the production. The film's scale, action sequences, and visual grandeur have been highlights, though the overall narrative and reception suggest mixed audience response.
