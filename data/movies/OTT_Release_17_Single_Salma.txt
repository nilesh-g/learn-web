BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Single Salma is a contemporary romantic comedy that challenges conventional expectations about women's roles, marriage, and self-actualization. The narrative centers on Salma Rizvi, a 33-year-old engineer from Lucknow who has dedicated her entire life to supporting her family financially and emotionally. Despite her professional achievements and independence as a working woman, she remains marginalized by her family and society due to her unmarried status. Her parents label her 'unsettled' and relentlessly pressure her to marry. When her parents arrange a match with Sikander Khan, a sincere and reliable clothing store owner, Salma accepts, seeing it as a path to peace. However, her life takes an unexpected turn when she is assigned to a professional project in London. There, she encounters Meet Singh Sahni, an urban planner who represents a completely different life trajectory. As Salma navigates between two contrasting worlds, two suitors with opposite values, and the weight of familial and societal expectations, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery. The film's unconventional climax subverts the typical rom-com resolution by having Salma reject both marriage proposals to pursue her independence, personal growth, and career ambitions.

AUDIENCE REVIEW
---

Single Salma has been received with appreciation for its subversion of traditional romantic comedy tropes, particularly the 'happy ending' expectation. Huma Qureshi's performance has been praised for her ability to convey a woman's internal conflict between familial duty and personal desire. Shreyas Talpade has been noted for his 'safe, reliable' portrayal of the traditional choice, while Sunny Singh brings energy to the role of the modern alternative. Audiences have particularly appreciated the film's refusal to suggest that a woman's value is defined by her relationship status. The film's handling of societal pressure and the 'log kya kahenge' mentality has resonated with viewers. Some have noted that while the screenplay occasionally feels preachy about feminism, the overall message of female autonomy and self-actualization is empowering. The subtle humor throughout has been highlighted as a strength. Audiences have found the film both entertaining and meaningful, particularly for viewers seeking stories that reflect contemporary women's experiences in India.
