Several years after the events of the first film, Yadav encounters a locked-room mass murder mystery where nearly all family members are found dead in sealed rooms. When the case initially implicates Aarav Bansal, the younger son and drug addict, Yadav begins his investigation. However, as he delves deeper, he uncovers a labyrinth of intrigue involving avarice, betrayal, and long-buried family secrets.
