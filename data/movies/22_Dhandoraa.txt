Brief Idea / Storyline:
Dhandoraa is a Telugu drama set in rural Telangana that explores the harsh realities of caste discrimination through a narrative infused with satire, humor, and emotion. The film centers around villagers who lose their farmlands when the Vaigai Dam is constructed. During periods when the dam has no water, they cultivate crops. However, when the dam fills up, these villagers turn to ganja smuggling for survival. The story follows Dhandoraa (meaning "drum"), a narrative device that unites the various stories of these ordinary people.
