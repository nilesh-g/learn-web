BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Revolver Rita is a dark comedy film that subverts expectations about female protagonists in action thrillers. The story revolves around Rita, an ordinary woman working at a chicken fast-food joint in the peaceful coastal town of Pondicherry. Her quiet, unremarkable life takes a drastic turn during her niece's birthday celebration when a notorious local gangster named Dracula Pandian accidentally enters her home while intoxicated and armed. In a heated confrontation, Rita's mother accidentally kills the gangster with a pressure cooker lid—a darkly comedic moment that sets off a chain of catastrophic events. Fearing the corrupt local inspector who holds a grudge against Rita, her family decides to hide the body rather than report the incident to authorities. What follows is Rita's transformation from an ordinary woman into 'Revolver Rita' as she navigates the dangerous underworld to protect her family from the gangster's vengeful son and the corrupt system. The film explores how an ordinary person can tap into extraordinary courage and resilience when their family is threatened, all while maintaining its darkly comedic tone.
