BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Eko is a Malayalam mystery thriller that marks the completion of cinematographer-director Bahul Ramesh's 'Animal Trilogy', following the success of Kishkindha Kaandam and Kerala Crime Files 2. The film is set in the misty, forested hills near the Kerala-Karnataka border, where an elderly woman named Mlaathi Chettathi lives in secluded isolation with her caretaker, Peeyous. Mlaathi is one of many wives of Kuriachan, an infamous dog breeder and fugitive being hunted by both government authorities and a terror group. While Kuriachan remains underground, his absence creates a vacuum that allows other characters to evolve and transform into increasingly suspicious versions of themselves, each doubting the true intentions of others. The arrival of strangers searching for Kuriachan—including a man named Mohan Pothan—catalyzes a series of mysterious deaths and revelations. As the investigation deepens, dark secrets about Kuriachan's past and his radical connections are unearthed. The film's slow-burn narrative builds tension through mood, visual imagery, and character interactions rather than traditional action sequences, creating an atmosphere of fear, confinement, and existential uncertainty.
