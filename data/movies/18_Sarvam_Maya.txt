Brief Idea / Storyline:
Sarvam Maya (Everything is a Delusion) is a Malayalam horror-comedy fantasy film that marks the return of Nivin Pauly to his beloved charming persona. The film follows Prabhendu, an aspiring guitarist who distances himself from his affluent Nampoothiri household to pursue music. Circumstances force him to return home where he and his cousin, played by Aju Varghese, exploit his knowledge of Vedas and rituals to make quick money. During an exorcism ritual, Prabhendu encounters a ghost—not the typical bloodthirsty kind found in Malayalam cinema, but a gentle spirit still trying to make sense of her existence. Named "Delulu" (meaning illusion), the ghost becomes a focal point of the narrative as Prabha and his cousin work to uncover her identity and help her attain salvation. The film blends these supernatural elements with comedy, romance, and emotional depth.
