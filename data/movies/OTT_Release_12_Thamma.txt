BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Thamma is an expansive entry into the Maddock Horror Comedy Universe, presenting a vampire tale rooted in Indian folklore and mythology. The film follows Alok, a journalist who encounters a mysterious woman named Tadaka and falls in love with her. His life takes a supernatural turn when he discovers that Tadaka belongs to a hidden world of Betaals—vampire-like creatures of ancient origin. Tadaka is bound to Yakshasan, a powerful and ancient ruler of darkness who seeks to expand his dominion over the human world. As Alok uncovers the truth about Tadaka and her origins, he finds himself caught between his love for her and the threat she and her kind pose to humanity. Together, Alok and Tadaka must band together to prevent Yakshasan from unleashing darkness upon the world. The narrative seamlessly blends supernatural horror elements with romance, drama, comedy, and heartfelt moments, creating a unique cinematic experience that hasn't been explored before in Hindi cinema.
