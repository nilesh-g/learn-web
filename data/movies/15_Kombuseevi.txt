Brief Idea / Storyline:
Kombuseevi is a Tamil-language gangster drama based on true events from 1996 in areas surrounding Vaigai Dam, particularly the towns of Andipatti and Usilampatti. The story revolves around villagers who lose their farmlands when the Vaigai Dam is constructed. During periods when the dam has no water, they cultivate crops, but when it fills up, they turn to ganja smuggling for survival. Leading this smuggling operation is Rokkapuli, played by R. Sarathkumar, who is assisted by Kombuseevi Pandi, portrayed by Shanmuga Pandian. Their involvement in smuggling creates constant conflict with the police. When they receive a major consignment order, the rivalry intensifies as police pressure increases, setting the stage for escalating conflict and dramatic confrontation.
