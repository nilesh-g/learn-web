BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Mrs Deshpande is a psychological crime thriller centered on Seema Deshpande, a former serial killer who spent 20 years in prison for killing eight men who had committed crimes. She emerges from prison to help track down a copycat killer who is replicating her murders from 20 years ago using her signature method: strangling victims with a green nylon rope and leaving their bodies in front of mirrors. As Officer Arun assigns talented investigator Tejas Phadke to work with her, a dangerous dynamic unfolds. The series explores themes of motherhood, revenge, justice, and the blurred lines between right and wrong as past secrets are unearthed.
