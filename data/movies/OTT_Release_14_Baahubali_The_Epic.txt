BRIEF IDEA / STORYLINE
---

Baahubali: The Epic is a re-edited, remastered single-film version of the legendary two-part Baahubali saga, created to celebrate the franchise's tenth anniversary. The film combines footage from Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali: The Conclusion (2017) into one epic narrative, featuring technical enhancements and a previously unreleased scene. At 3 hours and 43 minutes, it's one of the longest Indian films ever made. The story follows Sivudu, a young warrior raised in a tribal village who discovers his royal heritage and learns that he is Mahendra Baahubali, son of the noble and powerful prince Amarendra Baahubali. His father was betrayed and killed by his jealous uncle Bhallaladeva. Driven by this knowledge and a desire for justice, Mahendra embarks on a mission to liberate the kingdom of Mahishmati from its oppressive ruler. His journey involves epic conflicts, unlikely alliances, mythical revelations, and confrontations with both external enemies and internal demons. The film is a masterclass in world-building, featuring stunning visual effects, elaborate battle sequences, and a narrative that blends mythology with contemporary filmmaking techniques.
