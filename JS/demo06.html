    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>In JS, function can be treated as object. It can be assigned to another reference a.k.a. function alias. Using alias the actual function can be called.</li>
      <li>Function alias concept can be used to pass fn as argument to fn, Return fn from another fn, Create anonymous fns and Lambda expressions.</li>
      <li>Anonymous functions are created using function keyword, but not given any name. Anonymous fns assigned to alias and called via aliases only.</li>
      <li>Lambda fns are Shorthand anonymous fns. They can be one-liner or multiline. However, one-liners are preferred. Lambda functions introduced in ES6.</li>
      <li>A closure in JS is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any variables that were in scope at the time the function was created. Closures allow a function to access variables from its outer scope even after that scope has finished executing.</li>
    </ul>

      "use strict";
      // function definition
      function add(x, y) {
        let z = x + y;
        console.log(`add(): ${x} + ${y} = ${z}`);
      }
      console.log("add() -- type = " + typeof add + ", name = " + add.name);
      add(22, 7);

      // function alias
      const calc = add;
      console.log("calc -- type = " + typeof calc + ", name = " + calc.name);
      calc(23, 8);

      const multiply = (x, y) => {
        let z = x * y;

        let z = 1;

        function inner(x, y) {
          return x + y + z;
        }
        return inner;
      }
      // call outer fn & collect its return value
      const infn = outer();
      // call inner fn
      const result = infn(22, 7);
      console.log("final closure result = " + result);
